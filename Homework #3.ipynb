Plot the PSF and the encircled energy with and without the atmospheric phase variations.  Normalize the amplitude of your phase so that the seeing is approxamatly one arcminute.  Note: below you will average over multiple realizations which is what is needed to infer the true PSF-- this should be approxiate."

    "Sky brightness was recently measured at the Magellan Las Campanas Observatory in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad165c). They give a sky brightness in V-band of 22 mag / arcsec$^2$.   What is the limiting magnitude measureable given arcsecond seeing and what is measurable with an AO system turned on.  You may solve this analytically or with a simulation.  (When I was a child I remember seeing Jupiter through the Griffith park telescope during the day-- a related calculation explains how that works).  Discuss how AO impacts both imaging and spectrosacpy. "
