    "Compute the PSF for JWST with and with out the metiorite hit deformation.  A contour plot shown in this [article](https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope-micrometeoroid-picture) implies the deformation can be moddled as a appropriate sized gaussian with an amplitude of about 1000 nm.  Assume a 1000 nm wavelenght for your calculation.  Plot your model of the phase for the model of the mirror after the metiorite strike.  Plot the PSF with and with out this deformation in dB.  Also plot the differences of the beams with and without this effect.   A model for the JWST aperature fields can be found [here] (https://github.com/McMahonCosmologyGroup/cmbInstrumentSummerSchool/blob/main/Notebook3_bonus_optics.ipynb) use this as a starting point-- it will save you a huge amount of time."

Model the [primary mirror](https://giantmagellan.org/telescope-primary-mirrors/) as seven 8.4 m discs. [reference](https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/content/gmt-giant-magellan-telescope).  The central mirror segment has a circular hole which appears to be about 2.5 m in diameter.    You can ignore the blockage from the spider, and treat the blockage of the secondary as circular.  \n",

Model this effect by assuming each mirror is missaligned in the z-direciotn by an amount drawn from a gaussian distribution with a widht of 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 microns. Compare each of these PSFs and comment on the imapct and what constitiutes an acceptable controll over this effect.\n",
